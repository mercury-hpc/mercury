MERCURY
-------

These are the release notes for Mercury (as of 11/19/2014).

WHAT IS MERCURY?

   Mercury is an RPC framework specifically designed for use in HPC systems
   that allows asynchronous transfer of parameters and execution requests
   and direct support of large data arguments. The interface is generic
   to allow any function call to be shipped. The network implementation
   is abstracted, allowing easy porting to future systems and efficient use
   of existing native transport mechanisms.

   Please see the accompanying COPYING file for license details.

   Contributions and patches are welcomed but require a Contributor License
   Agreement (CLA) to be filled out. Please contact us if you are interested
   in contributing to Mercury.

ARCHITECTURES SUPPORTED:

   Architectures supported by MPI implementations are supported by the
   network abstraction layer. Both MPI and BMI plugins fully
   implement the network abstraction layer and are currently supported.
   Additional plugins are currently in development and will be added in
   future releases to support additional network protocols.

DOCUMENTATION:

 - Please see the accompanying design implementation documentation for
   additional and useful details.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:

   Compiling and running Mercury requires up-to-date versions of various
   software packages. Beware that using excessively old versions of these
   packages can cause indirect errors that are very difficult to track down.
   To make use of the MPI plugin, Mercury requires a _well-configured_ MPI
   implementation (MPICH2 v1.4.1 or higher / OpenMPI v1.6 or higher). For
   optional automatic code generation features (which are used for generating
   encoding and decoding routines), the preprocessor subset of the BOOST
   library must be included (Boost v1.48 or higher is recommended). On Linux
   OpenPA v1.0.3 or higher is required (the version that is included with MPICH
   can also be used).

BUILDING:

 - If you install the full sources, put the tarball in a directory where you
   have permissions (e.g., your home directory) and unpack it:

     gzip -cd mercury-X.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   or

     bzip2 -dc mercury-X.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -

   Replace "X" with the version number of the package.

 - (Optional) If you checked out the sources using git and want to build
   the testing suite (which requires the kwsys submodule), you need to issue
   from the root of the source directory the following command:

     git submodule update --init

 - Mercury makes use of the CMake build-system and requires that you do an
   out-of-source build. In order to do that, you must create a new build
   directory and run the 'ccmake' command from it:

     cd mercury-X
     mkdir build
     cd build
     ccmake .. (where ".." is the relative path to the mercury-X directory)

 - Type 'c' multiple times and choose suitable options. Recommended options
   are:

     BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                ON (or OFF if the library you link
                                      against requires static libraries)
     BUILD_TESTING                    ON
     Boost_INCLUDE_DIR                /path/to/include/directory
     CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX             /path/to/install/directory
     MERCURY_ENABLE_PARALLEL_TESTING  ON
     MERCURY_USE_BOOST_PP             ON
     MERCURY_USE_SYSTEM_MCHECKSUM     OFF
     MERCURY_USE_XDR                  OFF
     NA_USE_MPI                       ON
     OPA_INCLUDE_DIR                  /path/to/include/directory

   Setting include directory and library paths may require you to toggle to
   the advanced mode by typing 't'. Once you are done and do not see any
   errors, type 'g' to generate makefiles. Once you exit the CMake
   configuration screen and are ready to build the targets, do:

      make

 - (Optional) Verbose compile/build output:

   This is done by inserting "VERBOSE=1" in the "make" command. E.g.:

     make VERBOSE=1

INSTALLING:

 - Assuming that the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX has been set (see previous step)
   and that you have write permissions to the destination directory, do
   from the build directory:
   
     make install
     
TESTING:

 - Tests can be run to check that basic function shipping (metadata and bulk
   data transfers) is properly working. CTest is used to run the tests,
   simply run from the build directory:

     ctest .

 - (Optional) Verbose testing:

   This is done by inserting "-V" in the "ctest" command.  E.g.:

     ctest -V .

   Extra verbose information can be displayed by inserting "-VV". E.g.:

     ctest -VV .

 - Tests run with one server process and X client processes. To change the
   number of client processes that are being used, the MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS
   variable needs to be modified (toggle to advanced mode if you do not see
   it). The default value is 2.
   Note that you need to run 'make' again after the makefile generation
   to use the new value. Note also that this variable needs to be changed
   if you run the tests manually and use a different number of client
   processes.

 - (Optional) To run the tests manually with the MPI plugin open up two
   terminal windows, one for the server and one for the client. From the same
   directory where you have write permissions (so that the port configuration
   file can be written by the server and read by the client) do:

     mpirun -np 1 /path/to/binary/hg_test_server -c mpi

   and in the other:

     mpirun -np 2 /path/to/binary/hg_test_TESTNAME -c mpi
